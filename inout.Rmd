# Input / Output

We will learn how to:

* Read in a file
* Write out a file
* Save a graph to a file (Module 3)

## On vectors

* Read a file as a vector with the **scan** function

```{r, eval=F}
# Read in file
scan(file="file.txt")
# Save in  object
k <- scan(file="file.txt")
```


By default, scans "double" (numeric) elements: it fails if the input contains characters.<br>
If non-numeric, you need to specify the type of data contained in the file: 

```{r, eval=F}
# specify the type of data to scan
scan(file="file.txt", 
	what="character")
scan(file="~/file.txt", 
	what="character")
```

Regarding paths of files:<br>
If you don't specify the path, the file is assumed to be located in the current working directory (*getwd()*)
<br>
If the file is not in the current directory, you can provide a full or relative path. For example, if located in the home directory, read it as:

```{r, eval=F}
scan(file="~/file.txt", 
	what="character")
```

* Write the content of a vector in a file:

```{r, eval=F}
# create a vector
mygenes <- c("SMAD4", "DKK1", "ASXL3", "ERG", "CKLF", "TIAM1", "VHL", "BTD", "EMP1", "MALL", "PAX3")
# write in a file
write(x=mygenes, 
	file="gene_list.txt")
```

Regarding paths of files:<br>
When you write a file, without a path, it will be created in the current working directory.<br>
You can also provide a full or relative path:

```{r, eval=F}
# Write to home directory
write(x=mygenes,
        file="~/gene_list.txt")
# Write to one directory up
write(x=mygenes,
        file="../gene_list.txt")
```

**HANDS-ON**

1. Download file **inputA.txt** the following way, using the **download.file** function:

```{r, eval=F}
download.file(url="https://public-docs.crg.es/biocore/projects/training/R_introduction_2021/inputA.txt",
              destfile = "inputA.txt")

```
The file is now in your current working directory. Check with **dir()** (lists of files and folders).

2. Read in the content of **inputA.txt** using the **scan** function: save in object **z**.
How many elements does **z** contain?

3. **Sort vector z**: save sorted vector in the new object **zsorted** (see function **sort()**)

4. Write zsorted content into file **outputA.txt**, using the **write()** function.



## On data frames or matrices

* Read in a file into a data frame with the **read.table** function:

```{r, eval=F}
a <- read.table(file="file.txt")
```

You can convert it as a matrix, if needed, with:

```{r, eval=F}
a <- as.matrix(read.table(file="file.txt"))
```

* Write a data frame or matrix to a file:

```{r, eval=F}
write.table(x=a,
	file="file.txt")
```

Useful arguments:

* Note that **\\t** stands for tab-delimitation

* NOTE: **read.csv** derives from the read.table function, and reads **.csv** (comma-separated) files. **write.csv** also exists for writing **.csv** files.

**HANDS-ON**

1. Download **inputB.txt** the following way, using the **download.file** function:

```{r, eval=F}
download.file(url="https://public-docs.crg.es/biocore/projects/training/R_introduction_2021/inputB.txt",
              destfile = "inputB.txt")
```

2. Read in the content of **inputB.txt** using the **read.table** command; save in object **pop**. Note: inputB.txt has a header row!<br>
What are the dimensions of **pop**? What are the column names? Check the first rows of **pop** with the **head** function.

3. Select all states that are in the "Eurozone". What is the **total population** of the Eurozone, according to this table?

4. Write to file **Eurozone.csv** States and Capitals that belong to the "Eurozone". You need to select rows, as previously done, and also the State and Capital columns.
