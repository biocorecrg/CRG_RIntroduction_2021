# R basics

## Arithmetic operators

Use the R console as a calculator!

| Operator  | Function      |
|:--------: |:-------------:|
|     +     | addition      |
|     -     | subtraction   |
|     /     | division      |
|     *     | multiplication|
|  ^ or **  | exponential   |

In the R console:
```{r}
10 - 2
```
Hit **Enter/Return** for R to interpret the command.

## Simple calculations

Given the following table:

| type of RNA | Total   |
| :---------: |:-------:|
| mRNA        | 329     |
| miRNA       | 45      |
| snoRNA      | 12      |
| lncRNA      | 28      |


Calculate the total number of RNAs reported in the table:
```{r}
329 + 45 + 12 + 28
```
What is the percentage of miRNA?
```{r}
( 45 / 414 ) * 100
```

### **HANDS-ON** (3-5 minutes)

Given the following table (number of exons / introns of the hg38 genome, Gencode 31 annotation):
<br>
**Total number of genes: 60651**

Of which:
|||
| :--: | :--: |
| Protein-coding genes       | 19951      |
| Long non-coding RNA genes      | 17948      |
| Small non-coding RNA genes      | 7569      |
| Pseudogenes | 14773 |

1. How many genes are we missing to reach the total number of genes?
2. What is the percentage of long non-coding RNA genes?


## Objects in R

Everything that stores any kind of data in R is an **object**:

## Assignment operators

+ **<-** or **=**
+ Essentially the same but, to avoid confusions:
  + Use **<-** for assigning data to objects.
  + Keep **=** for functions arguments (we will talk about it in a next section).

## Assigning data to an object

<img src="images/rsyntax1.png" alt="rstudio logo" width="350"/>

* Assigning a value to the object **B**:
B <- 10

* NOTE: You can see the objects you created in the upper-right panel in RStudio: the environment.

* Reassigning: modifying the content of an object:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
B + 10
```

<span style="color:red">**B unchanged !!**</span><br>
```{r, eval=FALSE}
B <- B + 10
```

<span style="color:red">**B changed !!**</span><br>

## Using objects

You can use objects in your calculations:
<br>
Create objects A and B:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
A <- 7
B <- 10
```

Sum up A and B, and save the sum in C:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
A + B
C <- A + B
```

Note that if A or B change, C will NOT change, unless you re-run "C <- A + B"


## Names of objects

Naming objects in R is quite flexible. However, there are a few rules and good practices to consider:

* Object names are **case sensitive**: object **MyObject** is not the same as **myobject**
* They can contains both **numbers** or **letters** but should **START** with a letter, e.g. *2myobject* is not a valid object name.
* You can use **underscores**. Other **special characters** should be avoided.
* Avoid using function names as object names (e.g. do not create a **getwd** object).

### **HANDS-ON** (3-5 minutes)

1. Create the object **myfirstobject**, that contains the value **762**.
2. Create **mysecondobject**, that contains the value **80**.
3. Create **mythirdobject** , that contains the subtraction of **mysecondobject** from **myfirstobject**.
